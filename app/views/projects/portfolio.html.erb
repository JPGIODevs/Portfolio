        <h5><b>Many consider Rails dead...</b> I believe it to be more alive than ever!</h5>

        <b>huge collection of Gems(libaries), mature codebase and documentation</b> and we have a lively
        web development technology!</p>
        <br/>

        <h5><b>Hotwire also adds HUGE value to Rails</b>, providing HTML-centric approach to Responsive & Reactive webapps.</h5>
        <p>The use of Turbo and Stimulus, alongside the Sprockets asset-pipeline, provides an experience of similiar
        speed to a single-page app, without the indoctrination required for said single-page development!
        With all theese advantages, <b>fast development & scalability is made easy with Rails!</b></p>

            <p>Ontop of the usual Rails setup, I aimed to make development as fast & functional as possible, utlising
            other technologies to <b>Supercharge</b> my website in a time-frame that was acceptable!
            <br/>

            <h5>First is <b>Styling.</b></h5>
            <p>I used a combination of <b>Bootstrap 5 & ScSS</b>. Having had a background in CSS already,
            I saw it to be more practical to build upon the knowledge rather than to relearn the art using, persay,
            <b>TailwindCSS</b>. This made my custom styling <b>faster and Cleaner</b> as I utilised the nesting available in ScSS.</p>
            <br/>

            <h5>Second is <b>Data Storage.</b></h5>
            <p>In order to facilitate email forms, and <b>my live-chat</b>, <span><%= link_to "Found Here :)", projects_manifold_path%></span>,
            I needed a database. In my experience, <b>SQLite3</b> works well for light-to-medium applications and even <b>outperforms MySQL & Postgres
            in read-heavy applications.</b> As such, I chose said SQLite3 database and associated gems in use in my project, which <b>performed perfectly
            and integrated seemlessly!</p>

        <hr/>
        <p>With some tinkering, including Rails/Hotwire mastery and hours of efficiency fixes for instance, eventually my fully-fledged Rails Portfolio was hosted
        and delivered via <span><%= link_to "Hatchbox.io", "https://hatchbox.io" %></span> to much of my own elation! <br/>
        Overall, I was very pleased with the Rails development experience and how fast the turn-over was, even for a then-Novice Rails developer.<br/>
        The Use of Hotwire Frontend also made the application snappy and I couldnt be happier with the website's performance, even
        if it is a low-traffic portfolio website.</p>

        <p>First off is my choice of <b>Ruby-on-Rails</b>. Many people considered RoR to be a dead technology as solutions
        such as Node.js caused many to jumpship. To me, this is simply untrue.
